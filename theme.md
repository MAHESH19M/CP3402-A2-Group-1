# Theme Origin
The theme we had used for the site was originally the Hello Elementor Starter theme downloaded from the Elementor site, due to its user-friendliness, itâ€™s fast speed and general light weight, its high compatibility with Elementor as well as providing great customization options as it is essentially blank as well as providing regular updates and supports with a great amount of resources and an active community to provide support while building a site.

# Theme Features
The theme follows several guidelines in the building of a theme template, where the whitespaces had been managed identically, and the padding and margin all remain exactly the same for every single page. This was to ensure uniformity and cleanliness throughout the entire site. The header and footer were both edited using the WordPress editor.

# Design
Our website's design aesthetic centers around delivering a clean and uncluttered user experience. By prioritizing minimalism and a uniform colour scheme, we create an environment that focuses on essential information while maintaining an appealing visual appeal. This documentation outlines key design elements, such as a text-centric approach, limited use of images, and consistent margins and padding across all pages and viewports.

**Text Centric Approach**: To ensure a content-driven experience, we have intentionally placed emphasis on textual information throughout the website. By presenting information primarily through well-crafted and concise text, we allow visitors to easily digest and engage with the content. This approach fosters a sense of clarity and enables users to quickly find the information they seek.

**Limiting Images**: While images play a supporting role in enhancing the textual content, we have intentionally avoided cluttering the website with excessive visuals. By judiciously selecting and thoughtfully incorporating relevant images, we strike a balance between providing visual context and maintaining a streamlined design. This approach allows for faster loading times and a focused user experience.

**Clean Visuals**: The website's aesthetic exudes a rustic and clean vibe, promoting a sense of simplicity and elegance. With a carefully curated colour palette, we maintain a consistent and harmonious visual experience across all pages. By employing neutral tones and understated elements, we create a visually cohesive environment that is pleasing to the eye.

**Uniformity**: To achieve a polished and organized appearance, we have implemented uniform margins and padding on all pages, regardless of the viewport or device. Consistency in spacing ensures a balanced layout and contributes to an overall sense of professionalism. By meticulously maintaining these design principles, we guarantee a visually pleasing experience for all users.

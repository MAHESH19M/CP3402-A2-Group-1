# Theme Origin
The theme we had used for the site was originally the Hello Elementor Starter theme downloaded from the Elementor site, due to its user-friendliness, itâ€™s fast speed and general light weight, its high compatibility with Elementor as well as providing great customization options as it is essentially blank as well as providing regular updates and supports with a great amount of resources and an active community to provide support while building a site.

# Theme Features
The theme follows several guidelines in the building of a theme template, where the whitespaces had been managed identically, and the padding and margin all remain exactly the same for every single page. This was to ensure uniformity and cleanliness throughout the entire site. The header and footer were both edited using the WordPress editor.

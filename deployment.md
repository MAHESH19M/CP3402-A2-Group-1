# Applications and Processes
Efficient communication and seamless project management are paramount for the success of any collaborative endeavour. In our workflow, we have employed Discord, Notion, and GitHub as integral tools to facilitate daily communication, track progress, and manage our project effectively. This documentation provides an overview of each platform's role in supporting our team's collaboration and productivity.

**Discord**: Discord serves as our primary platform for daily communication and collaboration. Its versatile features enable us to share important links, provide updates, plan meetings, and exchange ideas, tutorials, and designs seamlessly. By utilizing Discord's text channels, voice channels, and direct messaging capabilities, we ensure effective and efficient communication within our team.

**Notion**: To maintain organized project management, we rely on Notion as our go-to tool. Notion's flexible and customizable interface allows us to create a centralized workspace where we can track tasks, monitor progress, and collaborate on various project aspects. Through Notion, we allocate tasks, define deadlines, and track completed tasks, ensuring transparency and accountability among team members.

**GitHub**: GitHub serves as our dedicated platform for version control and repository management. With GitHub, we create a repository where we store our project files, including the website's details, content, and associated assets. This enables us to effectively manage different versions of the project, collaborate on code development, and seamlessly integrate changes made by team members.

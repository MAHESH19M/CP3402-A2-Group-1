# Applications and Processes
Efficient communication and seamless project management are paramount for the success of any collaborative endeavour. In our workflow, we have employed Discord, Notion, and GitHub as integral tools to facilitate daily communication, track progress, and manage our project effectively. This documentation provides an overview of each platform's role in supporting our team's collaboration and productivity.

**Discord**: Discord serves as our primary platform for daily communication and collaboration. Its versatile features enable us to share important links, provide updates, plan meetings, and exchange ideas, tutorials, and designs seamlessly. By utilizing Discord's text channels, voice channels, and direct messaging capabilities, we ensure effective and efficient communication within our team.

**Notion**: To maintain organized project management, we rely on Notion as our go-to tool. Notion's flexible and customizable interface allows us to create a centralized workspace where we can track tasks, monitor progress, and collaborate on various project aspects. Through Notion, we allocate tasks, define deadlines, and track completed tasks, ensuring transparency and accountability among team members.

**GitHub**: GitHub serves as our dedicated platform for version control and repository management. With GitHub, we create a repository where we store our project files, including the website's details, content, and associated assets. This enables us to effectively manage different versions of the project, collaborate on code development, and seamlessly integrate changes made by team members.

# Hosting and Deployment
To provide a reliable and scalable hosting solution for our website, we have chosen Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our preferred cloud hosting provider. Leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure, we have utilized EC2 instances in conjunction with Bitnami's WordPress stack to streamline the development and management of our webpages. This documentation outlines our hosting setup and development workflow.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a comprehensive suite of cloud-based services, making it an ideal choice for hosting our website. By leveraging the power and scalability of AWS, we ensure high availability and optimal performance for our webpages. AWS provides a secure and flexible infrastructure that meets the needs of our growing online presence.

Within the AWS environment, we have set up an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance, which acts as a virtual server for hosting our website. To simplify the setup and management of our webpages, we have utilized the Bitnami WordPress stack. This stack includes the necessary components, such as the WordPress application, Apache web server, and MariaDB database, preconfigured for seamless deployment.

# Project Management
To streamline our website development process and ensure efficient task management, we adopted Notion as our project management tool. Leveraging the Kanban framework within Notion, we organized our tasks into three sections, allowing us to track items, visualize progress, and efficiently manage our project. This documentation outlines our use of Notion and the benefits it brought to our development workflow.

**Notion**: Notion is a versatile and collaborative workspace that offers a wide range of features for project management. By utilizing Notion, we were able to create an organized and centralized platform to track and manage our development tasks. Its intuitive interface and extensive customization options allowed us to tailor the workspace to our specific project needs.

**Kanban**: Within Notion, we implemented the Kanban framework to visualize our project's workflow. This framework organizes tasks into three distinct sections: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." Each section represents a different stage of the development process. This visual representation provided us with a clear overview of our project's progress and helped us identify any bottlenecks or areas that required attention.

**Overall Flow**: Notion's comprehensive feature set enabled us to create an overall flow for our project based on the tasks we needed to accomplish. By visualizing the project timeline, identifying dependencies, and assigning priorities, we optimized our development process. Additionally, the collaborative nature of Notion allowed team members to actively communicate, provide feedback, and address any challenges or roadblocks that arose during the development phase.

# Applications and Processes

For daily communication, we used Discord to communicate important links, keep providing updates, planning meetings, and sharing tutorials, ideas, and designs with each other, additionally we also used Notion for our project management, to track which tasks were being done and which tasks have been completed. Lastly, we created and used GitHub to upload our project into a repository with the details about our website and the content.

# Theme Development

For the WordPress theme we decided to go with the Hello Elementor theme, which is a lightweight blank theme which was highly compatible with Elementor which we would use for our project. This theme is blank and hence is perfect for adding customized widgets and call to action buttons.
The primary colour for the entire site has been white (#FFFFFF) with the CTA buttons in particular having a greenish colours to them, the primary colourâ€™s of this site are red and white keeping in line with the content provided to us, which showed that the primary colours of the website are blue and lime green in order to keep with the colour palette of the business.
For the header, we used another plugin called Envato Elements to develop a customized element theme for both the header and footer, the header contains the name of the business along with links to the other pages in the site towards right. The footer contains a small description about the business and the address of the business.

# Hosting and Development

For the hosting we used Amazon Web Services and developed an EC2 using bitnami to write webpages using WordPress.

# Project Management

We used Notion for Project Management and were following the Kanban Framework which utilizes visual tracking of all members and activities while developing the site, we had three sections to record tracking items, and sections which display what is to be done what is in the process of being done and what has been completed. Thanks to Notion and its myriad of features we were able to create an overall flow for the project based on the tasks we were to accomplish.

# Enviornment Overview

We used Amazon Web Services to set up our virtual environment, first we started a new instance, and for the software we used Ubuntu, and a virtual server was a t2.micro as it was free of cost.
